# Hugo Docker Image

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-BETA-yellow.svg)]()

This [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) Docker image is intended to be very basic mainly
for use in build systems and not for hosting a Hugo site beyond development.

There are two versions, the basic and the extended SASS and SCSS version. The
latter is tagged with `<version>-extended`.

Both images include RestructuredText support.
